Sprint 1 Report
Project C 
Group 7

	Sprint Goals: During this sprint our main goal was to implement the login/account creation part of our app. These goals are
	reflected in user stories 1, 2, 3, and 4. 

User Story 1: As a user, I want to create my own personal account, so that all my information is saved.
	
	Scenario/Test: User creates account
   Given a user click on the [Sign Up] button
   Then they should be taken to an account creation form page
   When they filled out the required information
   And click the [Sign Up] button
   Then they should have their account created.

	Explanation: This was done by creating a sign up page within the app. We then created a remote database, along with an API that
	allows the app to interact with the database, in order to save the users information once an account is created. 

User Story 2: As an athlete, I want to create my own athlete account, so that I can join challenges.
	
	Scenario/Test: User chooses an athlete account
   Given a user clicks on the [Sign Up] button
   Then they should be taken to an account creation form page
   When they filled out the required information and click [Sign Up]
   Then they are taken to the Account Type Page
   And click [Athlete]
   Then they should have their account created and registered as an athlete


	Explanation:This was done by giving creating a new page that allows the user to select the type of account they want to make after
	entering in their email, username, and password. Depending on the option they choose on this page, the isCoach value in the database
	will be set to either 0 or 1.

User Story 3: As a trainer/coach, I want to create my own coach account, so that I can be distinguished from other athletes.
	
	Scenario/Test: User chooses a coach account
   Given a user clicks on the [Sign Up] button
   Then they should be taken to an account creation form page
   When they filled out the required information and click [Sign Up]
   Then they are taken to the Account Type Page
   And click [Coach]
   Then they should have their account created and registered as an coach

	Explanation: This was implemented in the same way as user story 2.

User Story 4: As a user, I want to be able to log in with a unique Username and Password, so that all my information is private and secure.
	
	Scenario/Test: User logs in
   Given a user fills out the {Username} field that's already registered
   And {Password} fields with the correct password
   When they click the [Log in] button
   Then they should see their homepage

	
	Explanation: This was done by creating a login page which has a field for username and password. Once the user enters these values,
	a GET request is sent to the database, and the user is either directed to the homepage, or given an error message stating that the
	credentials are invalid.
